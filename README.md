# Jupyter Book 2 Wizard

An editing interface to edit Jupyter Books in the browser, based on the [TeachBook wizard](https://github.com/TeachBooks/Wizard/tree/main). 

⚠️ Currently it is not possible to add javascript to Jupyter Books ([see this issue](https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/issues/1040)). As a temporary solution, this project uses GitHub actions to add the required JS file (`script/start_wizard.js`) to the book after building.  

# Adding the editor 

Once GitHub pages are setup according to the [docs](https://mystmd.org/guide/deployment-github-pages), add the following section of code after 'Build HTML Assets' in `.github\workflows\deploy.yml`: 

```{code}
- name: Add wizard to book
uses: luukfroling/Wizard-jb2/actions@main 
with:
    script_url: "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/luukfroling/Wizard-jb2@main/script/start_wizard.js"
    html_dir: "_build/html"
```

The file should look like this: 

```{code}
- name: Build HTML Assets
  run: myst build --html

- name: Add wizard to book
  uses: luukfroling/Wizard-jb2/actions@main 
  with:
    script_url: "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/luukfroling/Wizard-jb2@main/script/start_wizard.js"
    html_dir: "_build/html"

- name: Upload artifact
  uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
  with:
    path: './_build/html'

```
